**Introduction to Adversarial Exemples**

This directory contains two files: 
 - Lecture slides: 00_Main_deep_robust.pdf
 - Associated notebook: adversarial_attacks.ipynb

These slides aim at providing an introduction to the notion of adversarial exmples in deep learning, focussing on how to build them.  
To practice, a Jupyter Notebook is also available.

For more details, see for instance [Adversarial Robustness - Theory and Practice](https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/)
