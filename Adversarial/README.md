# Introduction to Adversarial Exemples

## Description

This directory contains two files: 
 - Lecture slides: 00_Main_deep_robust.pdf
 - Associated notebook: adversarial_attacks.ipynb

## Abstract

These slides aim at providing an introduction to the notion of adversarial exmples in deep learning, focussing on how to build them.  
To practice, a Jupyter Notebook is also available.
